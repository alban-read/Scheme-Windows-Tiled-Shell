## Keys in the text panes

The text panes I believe like a normal windows app.

**shift-return** evaluates the selection

**ctrl-return** evaluates the pane.

Zoom in and out with **ctrl-mouse scroll**

**Arrow keys** move the cursor; most keys insert a character at the cursor.

**ctrl-d** duplicates the current line.

**page-up  page-down** move up and down the pane.

**home end** move to start and end of lines.

**shift-end** selects a line

**ctrl-home ctrl-end** move to start and end of text.

**ctrl-shift-home ctrl-shift-end** move to start or end of text; and select it.

**ctrl-arrow** will jump along the line.

**ctrl-shift-arrow** will jump along the line; selecting.

**tab** moves right 4 spaces.

**insert** switches between insert and overtype modes; cursor changes.

**delete**  deletes forward

**backspace** deletes back

**escape** safely attempts to stop a running script

(May not succeed if running the unmodified scheme DLLs)
