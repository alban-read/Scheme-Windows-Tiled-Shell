#### A note for old timers who miss the 8bit days

***Some old timers miss the constraints of the old 8bit days***

In the past you might have been constrained by an 8Mhz processor and some limited graphics hardware; today you are constrained by the need to move massive images in sixteen million colours; the constraints are just different.

***Some old timers miss the interactivity and direct access of the old 8bit days***

Welcome back to a *completely interactive environment.*

While generally safe to use you can probably still crash the app; by making a single mistake in some performance critical path. You will be pleased to hear I have crashed the graphics drivers many times writing the C part of the app.

The language used here (Scheme) was invented in the 1970s; it is not some 'fly by night' fad.

***Programming is just so easy now; it has become boring***

Sure; then write us all a great game; an application, or even a small demo.

This is not meant as a criticism; just a reminder that computers can still be fun; so enjoy them.

Speed is a feature and a virtue; you may feel a sense of locked out despair at the over-engineered complexity of Windows; but you can have some fun again; on cheap, fast, commodity hardware.

Get yourself a Ryzen and get going.
